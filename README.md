## What is Hyperfy?

Hyperfy is an open-source framework for building interactive 3D virtual worlds. It combines a powerful physics engine, networked real-time collaboration, and a component-based application system to create immersive experiences that can be self-hosted or connected to the wider Hyperfy ecosystem.

## üß¨ Key Features

- **Standalone persistent worlds** - Host on your own domain
- **Realtime content creation** - Build directly in-world
- **Interactive app system** - Create dynamic applications with JavaScript
- **Portable avatars** - Connect via Hyperfy for consistent identity
- **Physics-based interactions** - Built on PhysX for realistic simulation
- **WebXR support** - Experience worlds in VR
- **Extensible architecture** - Highly customizable for various use cases

## üå± Project Status

This project is still in alpha as we transition all of our [reference platform](https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy-ref) code into fully self hostable worlds.
Most features are already here in this repo but still need to be connected up to work with self hosting in mind.
Note that APIs are highly likely to change during this time.
